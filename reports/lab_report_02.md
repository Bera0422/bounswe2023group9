# Project Development Weekly Progress Report #2

**Team Name:** Collaborative Science Platform

**Date:** 10.10.2023

## Progress Summary

**This week** we focused on revising the project requirements and updating UML diagrams accordingly. We prepared our project plan and RAM for the management of the project. We updated wiki and onboarded new team members. We decided on subteams as front-end, back-end. These subteams focused on searching the technologies they will be using. The technology selection was finalized at the end of today's lab session. Some of the requirements and product specifications were discussed with the product owner in the lab session.

- **For database:** PostgreSQL, Supabase
- **For back-end:** Django, AWS
- **For hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **For front-end:** Flutter

**Subteams:**

- **Front-end Team**: Zülal, Bengisu, Abdullah, Mehmet, Ömer Faruk, Leyla
- **Back-end Team**: Ömer Şükrü, Ahmed Bera, Oğuz, Hakan, Arda, Ali Mert

**Our objective for the following week** will be to create codebases for the project and to implement some of the basic features of the platform such as log in, sign up. We aim to revise the project plan.

## Planned vs. Actual

- We decided on subteams on last meeting. But we could not finalize the subteams since we were waiting a response from the instructor about the restrictions on the technologies.
- We noticed that we need to determine tasks for project plan before we start to prepare the project plan.
- Some of the tasks were completed in the lab session due to the fact that we needed to discuss with the product owner and ask some questions to complete them.

## Your plans for the next week

## Risks

- Some of the tasks are dependent therefore we may have timing issues.
- Some of the team members are not familiar with the selected technologies. It might take more time to get familiar with the technologies and accomplish the tasks than we expected.
