## Risks

During our meeting, we talked about different frameworks that we can use. If we decide to use Flutter, we may encounter some performance issues.
In addition, our team is not highly experienced in other frameworks that we listed in the meeting. If we choose one of them, We may need to spend a lot of time learning the fundamentals of these tools.
